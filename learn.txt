We first create a Repository with a particular name.[Note that the name can never have spaces,so if we enter a name with spaces,git adds a hyphen in those spaces]
Next we clik the "add new file" and give a name("learn.txt") to the file which will be contained in this "HandsOnGit" repository.
Now we wish to save this file but observe that there is no such save option.Rather we have a "commit new file".Can be though of as a "save" option.
Observe that there are two options-The 1st being "Commit directly to the main branch".2nd being "Create a new branch..."
We first select the first one and press "commit new file".

After it has been saved we clck on "learn.txt" and click on edit option.On making changes we press-"Commit Changes" and also add a note-"Adding Line 7."
